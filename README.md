# Wine Quality Prediction – Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts the quality of wine based on chemical properties using a classification model.  
It covers the full ML workflow: data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset
- Source: [UCI Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)  
- Contains chemical properties of red and white wines, with quality scores from 0 to 10.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Model training using classification algorithms  
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance  
- Evaluation with accuracy metrics and confusion matrix
